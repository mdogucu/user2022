## Open-Access

- Cost of books and supplies for a student at a four-year university in 2021 was estimated to be $1240 per year ([Hanson, 2021](https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-textbooks)). 


- About 11% of the students indicated that they skipped meals in order to afford books and course materials ([Hanson, 2021](https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-textbooks)).

- The bayesrulesbook.com page has been accessed from more than 150 countries.

## Assistive Technology

Assistive Technology is any form of technology (software, device) that helps people with disabilities perform certain activities. 

Examples:

- walking sticks
- wheel chairs
- screen readers

---

class: middle

## Screen reader


A screen reader is an assistive technology that supports blind or visually impaired people in using their computer.

The video shows use of a screen reader briefly.

class: middle

## Alternate Text

- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- It is used in HTML pages. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 


---

class: middle

In (northern) Summer 2020, we had lots of images but no way to provide alternate text within HTML so we asked for alternate text feature.

## Embracing mistakes as part of learning

&gt; As you read the book and put Bayesian methodology into practice, you will make mistakes. Many mistakes. Making and learning from mistakes is simply part of learning. We hope that you persist through the struggle of learning so that you can contribute your unique insights, perspectives, and experiences to the Bayesian community.

## Accessibility as Career Preparation

[Accessible Technology Skills Gap Report  by The Partnership on Employment &amp; Accessible Technology (PEAT), 2018](https://www.peatworks.org/infographic-the-accessible-technology-skills-gap/)

84% of industry respondents say it is important or very important to their company to hire developers and designers with accessible technology skills.


60% said it was difficult or very difficult for their organization to find job candidates with accessibility skills. 0% said it was easy or very easy.

41% of companies consider accessibility certification credentials as a differentiator in hiring.

## Curriculum Goal

As educators, we have to ensure that the current and the next generation of data scientists, provide public-facing outputs (websites, analysis reports, etc.) that are accessible.


---

class: middle

## Learning Objectives

- Students should get familiar with American Disabilities Act and/or United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
- Students should use at least one assistive technology (i.e. screen reader).
- Students should consider different representations of data.



---

class: middle

Students can use screen reader on Windows and Mac

- If you are on a Windows machine go to Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Narrator, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.

- If you are on a Mac go to System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Voice Over &gt; Enable Voice Over

### Manual Alternate Text

- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)

.pull-right[

- Description conveys meaning in the data

- Variables included on the axes

- Scale described within the description

- Type of plot is described

### Data Verbalization -  Automated

### Data Verbalization -  Automated



```r
BrailleR::VI(example_barplot)
```

```
## This is an untitled chart with no subtitle or caption.
## It has x-axis 'transmission' with labels automatic and manual.
## It has y-axis 'count' with labels 0, 5, 10 and 15.
## The chart is a bar chart with 2 vertical bars.
## Bar 1 is centered horizontally at automatic, and spans vertically from 0 to 19.
## Bar 2 is centered horizontally at manual, and spans vertically from 0 to 13.
```

&lt;hr&gt;

Drawback of using `VI()` is that not every type of plot can be verbalized yet.

Different representations of data is one way of introducing accessibility to students but it is not meant to be a complete introduction to accessibility.

Recommendations for the Community

---


class: middle rec

~~A picture is worth a thousand words.~~

An alternate text is worth thousand pictures.

---

class: middle rec

~~Fixing a typo is a good first pull request~~

Fixing a typo and writing alternate text (if you are sighted) are good pull requests.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility features should not be accidental. 

---

class: middle rec

Disclosure should fall on event (including meetups) organizers.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility should not fall on volunteers.   
In communities where work is solely based on volunteers then volunteer(s) for accessibility should be considered.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility should be taught at undergraduate, graduate, and equivalent practitioner trainings.


---

class: middle rec

Accessibility can be taught as part of language specific (e.g. R) and language agnostic trainings.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility should be taught in a way that learners can apply their learning in non-data contexts.

---

class: middle rec

Students should be assessed on and held accountable for their accessibility practices.

---

class: middle rec


Accessibility is for everyone.
